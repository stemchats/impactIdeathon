                By 2050, the world will need to feed 9 billion people. The number of people living in cities will triple. One third to one half of rain forests will vanish. Diseases will be deadlier than ever. The Impact Ideathon is hopefully the first of many Virtual Design Thinking Challenges hosted by United Engineers and STEMchats.

                Projects can take the form of computer programs, 3D models, graphic designs, pure academic research, or any other medium which can be tested and innovated upon. Participants will use design thinking and the engineering design process to evolve their solution to something that can be implemented.

                The Impact Ideathon is a competition for students ages 16-18 who will collaborate to identify the world's greatest sustainable development challenges and propose solutions that will shape our future. Throughout this Ideathon, teams will select an idea to develop, justify, and present as a solution in response to a problem.
