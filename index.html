                        Projects can take the form of computer programs, 3D models, graphic designs, pure academic research, or any other medium which can be tested and innovated upon. Participants will use design thinking and the engineering design process to evolve their solution to something that can be implemented.

                        <blockquote>Impact Ideathon was recommended to me by another technology organization. I was curious about it and when I saw the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, I was really excited. I decided to register and I was impressed that communication was organized through Slack instead of emails and texts. I was able to meet and connect with multiple smart students my age! I finally felt like I had a support group. The events were well organized and I was very inspired by the speakers’ presentations and life stories. Being my first hackathon, I had no clue where to begin but I was provided numerous resources that I was able to use to design my project. Moreover, we were provided useful workshops with extremely talented and diligent software engineers in the most elite educational institutes and companies. My first hackathon experience was amazing and I am grateful United Engineers and STEMchats were able to help me in each way possible.</blockquote>

All of the organizers were extremely nice and accommodating, and I could tell that the planning and execution of the event was done very meticulously. They were very encouraging and the environment they have created allowed everyone to interact freely, learn, and have fun!

However, through this event and its workshops, I was able to learn more about various programs, as well as valuable skills, that were able to help me and my team fully develop our idea. This Ideathon was definitely a great learning experience! I can truly say that I learned a lot, not only regarding project planning but also regarding teamwork and coordination. I would certainly participate in one again!</blockquote>

Who was I going to meet there and what would the program’s schedule be like? When the event started, I was met with kind and compassionate organizers, who made the program straightforward and made me feel more comfortable being at the event, and nice team members (who would work together with me to create an impactful idea to present from scratch). The guest speakers each shared a valuable and unique part of their life experiences and the workshops proved to be fun to engage in. It also wasn’t mandatory to participate all in the speaker and workshop events, allowing some people like me to put a bit more time into the group project. If there is one/two things to take away from this program, it is that hard work/determination and building those interactive relationships pays off in the long-run.</blockquote>
